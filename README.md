Java History Quiz asks you 15 historical/social studies questions with 4 answer choices: a,b,c,d. I made my project in Java, with the user inputing either a,b,c,d for their answer. It then tells you if you are right or wrong and the correct answer choice if you are wrong. I made this project to test my java input skills, which I recently learned in AP CSP. This program wasn't too difficult for me, although I did have to learn if and else conditionals myself.
